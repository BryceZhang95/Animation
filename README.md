# Physics-Based Motion Control System 

### System Review
* Implement an animation system to generate the motion of an articulated figure using forward-kinematics plus the motions of rigid bodies using physical principles. Behavior simulation is also implemented here using BOID model.
* Rendering pipeline, roaming camera, texture map and skybox are implemented in the system using OpenGL.
