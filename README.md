# Physics-Based Motion Control System 

1. Implement an animation system to generate the motion of an articulated figure using forward-kinematics plus the motions of rigid bodies using physical principles. Behavior simulation is also implemented here using BOID model.
2. Rendering pipeline, roaming camera, texture map and skybox are implemented in the system using OpenGL.
